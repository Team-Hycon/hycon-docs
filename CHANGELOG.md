### March 22, 2016

* Fixes non-unique IDs on section headers.
* You can now run `npm run build` multiple times without any problems.

### March 17, 2016

* Support for linking to specific languages. URLs were previously like
  `#the-section` but now are `?language=JavaScript#the-section` when a language
  is selected, so that you can link to both a specific section and a specific
  language.
* Changes how Docbox uses highlight.js - instead of including tons and tons
  of languages, we include only a few.

### March 14, 2016

* Support for toggling between 1 and 2 column mode
